Principal's Message

Education is not merely imparting knowledge or information but it is an ongoing process of formation.
It can be formal or informal, the important aspect is, it has a formative effect in the way one thinks, feels and acts.
According to Aristotle “The purpose of education is to edify oneself and be beneficial to society.”
